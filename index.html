						<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
					</header>
						<p>Early in my career, I discovered that mastering the art of music making is similar to learning sports, science, math,
						and any other skills. As with any highly-skilled activity, a desireable outcome
						will require time, persistence, thoughtful practice, mentorship, experience,
						and a lot of passion. 'Talented', 'gifted' and prodidy are common terms terms
						used in our culture to describe musicians. However, it is the students who
						seek challenges and growth that possess the greatest gift of all.</p>

						<p>I strive to highlight my students' existing passions and
						channel those qualities into their music. My role is to guide my
						students in developing into the best version of themselves.
						No different than the busy daily lives of modern people, we celebrate successes, experience setbacks, and incrementally become better than we were yesterday. I invite you to channel your musical experience into your everyday experiences.</p>
